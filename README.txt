It is a virtual machine for the MIX computer architecture described in
TAOCP Vol 1.
It also has an assembler for MIXAL ("MIX Assembly Language").

I wrote this in Dec 2010 when I had been programming for less than 6
months, so some of it is quite cringeworthy.

But this was a good learning experience. Essentially, it was meant to be a
way to get experience with JS and HTML. But by writing a virtual machine
and assembler, I indirectly picked up some experience with machine code and
assemblers.

It turns out that MIX is a hilariously dated computer architecture and so
only the highest-level concepts of the machine code / assembler carry over
to other stuff.
